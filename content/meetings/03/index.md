### ON YOUR OWN

Read Chapter 2, There is a Solution, and be prepared to discuss your reaction to this chapter next week. Continue to write how you are powerless over alcohol and begin to consider what in your life you can truly manage.

As thoughts occur to you about whether or not you can manage your life, write them down in your notebook.

WITH THE GROUP:

Read Chapter 2, There is a Solution.

- Having read this chapter, what parts apply to your life?
- What is your reaction to the members of Alcoholics Anonymous?
- Did your alcoholism engulf “all whose lives touch the sufferer’s”? (Page 18)
- What was their reaction?
- Do you see how you can reach another alcoholic? (Page 18)
- Note on page 20 the Book answers the question, “What do I have to do?”
- Have you been asked the questions on page 20 by yourself or others?
- What were your answers?
- From your examination of yourself and your reading of this chapter, are you a “real alcoholic”? (Page 21)
- If not, why not? Discuss this with the team.
- Did you have control over alcohol? Did you do absurd, incredible, and tragic things while drinking? Were you a Jekyll and Hyde type of person? These questions and the observations on page 21 may help you in answering the questions you’ve been writing about having to do with your powerlessness over alcohol.
- Why did we drink the way we did? (Page 22)
- Why do we take that first drink?
- Why can’t we stay on the wagon?
- What has become of the common sense and will power that the alcoholic still sometimes displays with respect to other matters?
- Have you lost the power of choice as described on page 24?
- Have you ever asked, “What’s the use anyhow?”

Reread the first paragraph on page 25 starting with “There is a solution” and the second one which says, “The great fact is this and nothing less: that we have had deep and effective spiritual experiences which have revolutionized our whole attitude toward life...” The rest of this paragraph is an outstanding summary of what happens in this program.

In conjunction with the above two paragraphs, read, discuss and understand Appendix II, Spiritual Experience, page 569. Note that Appendix II, Spiritual Experience, is referred to once again on page 27.
