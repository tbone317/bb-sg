### ON YOUR OWN

Read Chapter 3, More About Alcoholism, and determine how it applies to your life.

WITH THE GROUP:

Read Chapter 3, More About Alcoholism.

- Did you have “the great obsession”? (Page 30)
- Did you realize it was an illusion?
- Did you try to control your drinking?
- Were you able to diagnose your disease?
- In your notebook, have you listed those things, which you attempted and which failed to control your drinking?
- Do you have a reservation of any kind or any lurking notions that you will some day be immune to alcohol? (Page 33)
- Do you identify with the mental states that precede a relapse into drinking, and do you understand that these mental states are “the crux of the (drinking) problem”?
- Do you understand why an alcoholic or potential alcoholic will be absolutely unable to stop drinking on the basis of self-knowledge? (Page 39)
- Note, on page 43, the doctors’ reaction to these conclusions about alcoholism.
- At the bottom of the page and at the end of the chapter, once again note the only defense against the first drink.
