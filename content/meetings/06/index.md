### ON YOUR OWN


Read and be prepared to discuss Chapter 5, “How it Works”. In your notebook, write those things about God which you cannot believe. On another page, write what you do believe about God. As you go forward from this point it’s those things which you do believe or which fit into your concept of God which you will be using, and you can be comforted in knowing that “Our own conception, however inadequate, was sufficient to make the approach and to effect a contact with Him.” (Page 46)

List in your notebook examples of how you have been selfcentered in the past.

WITH THE GROUP:

Read Chapter 5, “How it Works”.

Discuss the material from the beginning of the chapter to the end of page 63; i.e., to the end of the Third Step.

Do you question whether you are capable of being honest with yourself? (If you do, you are not.)

Note the state of mind you are asked to have when you start the Steps  honesty, fearlessness, thoroughness and willingness to go to any length.

- What is the value of half measures?
- Are you convinced a life run on selfwill can hardly be successful?
- Can you see the effects of selfcenteredness in your life?
- How have you been selfcentered? Discuss with the group.
- Did you know that you cannot significantly reduce selfcenteredness by wishing or by trying on your willpower? (Page 62) Are you willing to make the decision that is set forth at the bottom of page 62?
- Note the promises on page 63 that follow the Third Step.
- Are you sincerely willing to take this Step?

AT THIS POINT, WITNESS EACH OTHER’S THIRD STEP DECISION BY RECITING THE THIRD STEP PRAYER TOGETHER.
