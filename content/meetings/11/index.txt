### ON YOUR OWN


Complete Instructions 10 and 11.

W I T H  T H E  G R O U P :

Review and discuss in general what you have written on sex. Do not give specifics or tell

“war stories”. These are not appropriate for this meeting.

INSTRUCTION 10  SEX SITUATIONS

Read the last paragraph on page 68 to the end of Chapter 5.

List the people and situations wherein sex and sexual relationships have been a problem

for you.

With respect to each person on your list, write a short paragraph answering the following

questions while remembering to deal with specific events:

1.

2.

3.

In this relationship, was I selfish, dishonest, inconsiderate?

Whom did I hurt?

Did I arouse suspicion?

 14

4.

5.

6.

Did I arouse bitterness?

Where was I at fault?

What should I have done instead?

Become willing to make amends for past wrongs  provided you will not bring about still

more harm in so doing. Consider your future sex life and relationships. Through study

and prayer, seek to shape a sane and sound ideal for the future. Whatever your ideal turns

out to be, you must be willing to grow toward it.

In the second paragraph on page 70, we are given instructions on how to proceed.

We are told:

“Pray for the right ideal, for guidance in each questionable situation,

for sanity and for the strength to do the right thing. If sex is very

troublesome, we throw ourselves the harder into helping others. We

think of their needs and work for them. This takes us out of ourselves.

It quiets the imperious urge, when to yield would mean heartache.”

INSTRUCTION 11 _STEP 5

Review your inventory. Have you left anything out? Have you failed to list any event or

subject because the memory and the thought of revealing it to another person made you

too uncomfortable? If so, write it down now. (Read page 72 through page 75).

TAKE THE FIFTH.

[Don’t procrastinate while looking for the “right” person. Get it over with! You’ve

already turned your will and life over to the care of God; nothing is going to happen to

you that God can’t take care of.  Ed.]

Congratulations! You have now completed Steps Four and Five.
