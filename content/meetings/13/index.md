### ON YOUR OWN


If you haven’t taken your Fifth Step, do so this week.

[Don’t worry too much who that person will be. Anyone is better than no one, but

because it is a spiritual experience, you might want to share it with someone on the

program rather than with an outsider. ~ Ed.]

Read Chapter 6 in Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.

WITH THE GROUP:

Discuss this chapter and the Sixth Step.

What is the significance of the sentence, “This is the step that separates the men from the

boys....?

Discuss those defects of character which you recognize in yourself which you believe

stand in the way of your usefulness to your fellows.

Consider also those defects which you feel do not stand in the way of your usefulness to

others.

Notice how relatively few defects (column 4 in your inventory) caused such a long list of

resentments (column 1).

What are you asked to do about these defects?

Is willpower and trying harder a part of this Step?
