### ON YOUR OWN


Read from the middle of page 76 to the middle of page 77 in The Big Book and Chapter

8 in Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.

Note that The Big Book assumes you made a list of persons you had harmed when you

wrote your inventory. If you didn’t, complete such a list now. Don’t concern yourself at

this time with whether or not you should, or will be able to, actually make the amends.

WITH THE GROUP:

Read and discuss the assignment.

Discuss amends and amends lists.
