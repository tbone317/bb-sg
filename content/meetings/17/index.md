### ON YOUR OWN


Read Chapter 10 in Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions and from the bottom of page 83

to the bottom of page 85 in The Big Book.

W I T H  T H E  G R O U P :

Read and discuss the assignment. What are the specific instructions for the Tenth Step?

What do we watch for? Why is it important to admit a wrong “promptly”? Note that “we

have ceased righting anything and anyone ... by this time sanity will have returned ... we

will seldom be interested in alcohol.” Is this the sanity referred to in the Second Step?

What is the proper use of willpower? (Page 85).
