### ON YOUR OWN

Read Chapter 8, “To Wives”; Chapter 9, “The Family Afterwards”; chapter 10, “To

Employers” and Chapter 11,”A Vision for you”. These chapters are designed to teach you

how to practice these principles in all your affairs. They contain spiritual truths, which

apply to all of us.

W I T H  T H E  G R O U P :

The team should decide whether or not to discuss one or more of these chapters to

conclude your Step Study.

A reading of the last portion of “A Vision for you” is a fitting way to end the Step Study

program.

Do you have the feeling of having had contact with those who wrote The Big Book?

And finally, always remember,

in precisely the middle of page 132

our Big Book states:

“WE ABSOLUTELY INSIST ON ENJOYING LIFE.”
