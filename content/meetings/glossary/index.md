In an attempt to discover the meaning of the words used in our basis text book Alcoholics Anonymous

when it was written, we have used many sources for this glossary. Our primary source was Webster’s Daily

Use Dictionary published in 1934. For the historical references we used the World Book Encyclopedia and

Encarta Encyclopedia. Because our language has changed much since our “Big Book” was written, and

because the book’s purpose is to explain, “precisely how we have recovered”, we believe it is important to

 25

understand what the words meant when they were written, not how the have been filtered by our society

today. This glossary is not complete by any means but is meant to be helpful.
