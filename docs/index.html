    <article><div><h1>TWELVE STEPS STUDY GROUP</h1><h2>FOREWORD</h2><p>The following is a suggested format for a Big Book Step Study Group with emphasis on the Fourth Step. We will be using the books Alcoholics Anonymous, Plain Language Big Book, and The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions. This does not imply either approval of or endorsement, rather as a guide to find our own way in our spiritual quest.</p><p>The material is presented here in a form which has been used by both individuals and groups of recovering alcoholics to study the first 164 pages of the Big Book while actually doing the Steps.</p><p>The only authority on the Twelve Steps is the book Alcoholics Anonymous  referred to as “the Big Book, the Basic Text for Alcoholics Anonymous”.</p><p>Ch.1 Bill’s Story--------------------------Step 1</p><p>Ch.2 There Is a Solution-----------------Step 1</p><p>Ch.3 More About Alcoholism  Step 1</p><p>Ch.4 We Agnostics  Step 2</p><p>Ch.5 How It Works ----Steps 3 and 4</p><p>Ch.6 Into Action ----- Steps 5 thru 11</p><p>Ch.7 Working With Others  Step 12</p><p>It is these 12 Steps, these seven chapters, when we allow them, can change the course of our lives.</p><p>Whenever the Group reads a chapter of the book Alcoholics Anonymous the expectation will be to also read the corresponding chapter from Plain Language Big Book, a Tool for Reading Alcoholics Anonymous.</p><p>Membership on the Group is predicated on a commitment by each member to: 1) Read the assignment and answer the questions before each meeting. 2) Attend every meeting. 3) Maintain contact with other team member between meetings. 4) Stay with the team until all 12 Steps have been covered.</p><p>The time spent on each Step may be shortened or extended at the discretion of the Group, but unnecessary delays should be avoided.</p><p><a href="meetings/01/">Week One</a> <a href="meetings/02/">Week Two</a> <a href="meetings/03/">Week Three</a></p><p><a href="references">References</a> <a href="schedule">Schedule</a></p></div></article>
