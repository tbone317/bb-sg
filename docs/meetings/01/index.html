Note that in the Foreword to the First Edition, the Big Book states: “To show other alcoholics precisely how we have recovered is the main purpose of this book.” On page 29 at the end of Chapter 2 it says, “Further on, clearcut directions are given showing how we recovered.” These statements point out the task the team is about to undertake.</p><h3>WITH THE GROUP:</h3><p>Discuss the purpose, plan and meeting format of the Step Study Group. It is important that each member understand he or she is expected to do each of the Steps and, if possible, to attend every meeting of the team. This is a commitment, a team effort.</p><p>Frequent progress reports and mutual support via the telephone during the week are important.</p><p>At the first meeting read and discuss The Doctor’s Opinion. - Are you aware that your illness affected both your mind and your body? - Do you believe or can you accept the concept of an allergic reaction to alcohol? - What is an allergy? - Do you agree with the idea of hospitalization? - Have you ever experienced the phenomenon of craving? (Page XXVI) - Did you like the effect of alcohol? - Did you reach the point where you could not differentiate “the true from the false”? - Did your alcoholic life seem normal? - The doctor seems to say that a “psychic change” must occur. What is a psychic change? - Can you accept the fact that alcoholism “has never been, by any treatment with which weare familiar, permanently eradicated”?</p><p>These and many other questions will occur to the group and each should be discussed in depth.</p><p><a href="/bb-sg/schedule.html">Back to schedule</a></p><p><a href="/bb-sg/meetings/glossary">Glossary →</a></p></div></article>
