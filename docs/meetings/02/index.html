Begin to write “How I was powerless over alcohol.” It is important that you write out any reservations you still have that you are, indeed, powerless over alcohol. For type of notebook you might want to buy a spiral notebook as we will need one for our Fourth Step directions.</p><p>Read Chapter 1, Bill’s Story, and be prepared to discuss at next week’s meeting how it applies to your life.</p><p>WITH THE GROUP:</p><p>Read Chapter 1, Bill’s Story.</p><ul><li>Did you ever wonder if you were crazy? (Page 5)</li><li>Did you ever feel the remorse, horror and hopelessness of the next morning? (Page 6)</li><li>Did your mind ever race uncontrollably? (Page 6)</li><li>Did you ever seek oblivion? (Page 6)</li><li>Did you feel lonely? (Page 6)</li><li>Did you feel fear? (Page 6)</li><li>What was your reaction to religion, the church and God? (Page 10)</li><li>Note what happened to Bill’s prejudice against “their God” when he began to use his own concept of God. (Page 12)</li><li>Did you know that “nothing more was required ... to make my beginning” than a willingness to believe?</li><li>Notice how Bill was instructed to rind God’s will and to pray. (Page 13)</li><li>Isn’t it true that Bill essentially takes the First through Eleventh Steps at this time while still in the hospital? (Page 13)</li></ul><p>These are just samples of the sort of questions to be asked or points to be raised. What was of particular significance to you in this chapter? What did you find that you cannot agree with or that you cannot accept?</p><p><a href="/bb-sg/meetings/01">← Previous meeting</a></p><p><a href="/bb-sg/schedule.html">Back to schedule</a></p><p><a href="/bb-sg/meetings/glossary">Glossary →</a></p></div></article>
