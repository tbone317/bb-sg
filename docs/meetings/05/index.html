By now, you should have finished writing most of your memories about why you are powerless over alcohol and why your life is unmanageable.</p><p>WITH THE GROUP:</p><p>Read Chapter 4, We Agnostics.</p><ul><li>Do you accept the fact that if you are an alcoholic, you have only two alternatives: either die an alcoholic death or live life on a spiritual basis? (Page 44)</li><li>Have you lacked the power to manage your life? (Page 45)</li><li>Note: The main object of this book is to enable you to find a power greater than yourself, which will solve your problem.</li><li>Have you had honest doubts and prejudices about God? (Page 45)</li><li>What was your reaction to the word “God”? (What will He look like; what will it be like when you find Him?) Where did you get these ideas?</li><li>Had you abandoned the idea of God completely? (Page 45)</li><li>Are you willing to lay aside your previous beliefs and prejudices and have merely a willingness to believe in a power greater than yourself?</li><li>What is your current concept of God? (Page 45)</li><li>Do you now believe or are you at least willing to believe there is a power greater than yourself? (Page 47)</li><li>Do you recognize that when you say, “yes” to this question you are “on your way”? (Page47)</li><li>Note that the Book at this point again refers you to Appendix 11, Spiritual Experience.</li><li>What is it about Appendix II, Spiritual Experience that is indispensable?</li><li>Have you been openminded, or have you been obstinate, sensitive and unreasonably prejudiced about discussions about God?</li><li>Did your idea work? Will the God idea work? (Page 57)</li><li>Are you ready to “fearlessly face the proposition that either God is everything or He is nothing? God either is or He isn’t.” What is your choice to be? (Page 57)</li><li>Recall what was said on page 28: If what we have learned and felt and seen means anything at all, it means all of us, whatever our race, creed or color, are the children of a living Creator with whom we may form a relationship upon simple and understandable terms as soon as we are willing and honest enough to try.</li></ul><p><a href="/meetings/04">← Previous meeting</a></p><p><a href="/schedule.html">Back to schedule</a></p><p><a href="/meetings/glossary">Glossary →</a></p></div></article>
