Start to work on Step 4. Follow instructions I and 2 and write your Grudge List.</p><p>INSTRUCTION I RESENTMENTS</p><p>Read the following and come to understand what we are doing.</p><p>WHEN TO DO STEP FOUR AND WHY</p><p>Perhaps the greatest of the promises of the program of Alcoholics Anonymous is that God, as we understand Him, will do for us what we cannot do for ourselves. Once we’ve made the decision to let Him do that, as required by Step Three, the Big Book warns us, “Though our decision was a vital and crucial step, it could have little permanent effect unless at once followed by a strenuous effort to face, and to be rid of, the things in ourselves which had been blocking us (from God).... So we had to get down to causes and conditions. Therefore, we started upon a personal inventory.”</p><p>WHAT WE SEEK</p><p>The inventory is described as “a factfinding and factfacing process”. We seek the truth about ourselves and honestly take stock of our lives. We search out the flaws in our makeup that caused our failure. The Big Book states repeatedly that self, selfishness, selfcenteredness are the root of our trouble. Convinced that self, manifested in various ways, was what had defeated us, we consider its common manifestations and group them into three categories: (1) Resentments, (2) Fear, (3) Sex. We then treat each category separately in the inventory.</p><p>RESENTMENTS “THE NUMBER ONE OFFENDER”</p><p>From resentments, “stem all form of spiritual disease”. We are instructed to list all the people, institutions or principles with whom we were angry or had resentments. What is resentment?</p><ul><li>A) Webster’s New Twentieth Century Dictionary defines “resentment” as “a feeling of displeasure or indignation, from a sense of being injured or offended.” Suggested synonyms include anger, wrath, ire, and indignation.</li><li>B) Anger can be strong, intense, explosive, and brief. Resentments often are more suppressed, longerlasting and chronic  the “slow burn”. Resentment has been described, as the feeling I have when I think someone else ought to feel guilty.</li><li>C) We are dealing with a destructive, negative, unpleasant action or inaction of a person, institution or principle. The “person” may be oneself. Our actions, or our failures to do what we think we should have, can generate the resentment referred to as “guilt”. “Institutions” may be authorities, companies, governments, government agencies, groups of people or various organizations. “Principles” are truths, some of which offend us; e.g.,</li></ul><p>1) Alcoholism is an incurable disease. 2) Honesty is the best policy 3) As you give so shall you receive 4) When you are disturbed, no matter what the cause, there is something wrong with you.</p><p>The specific instructions for taking Step Four are found on pages 64 to 71 in the book Alcoholics Anonymous and should be read carefully at this time.</p><p>INSTRUCTION 2  GRUDGE LIST</p><p>Prepare your Grudge List. List the people, institutions and principles, which have caused you to have resentment as defined above. Go back over your life. “Nothing counts but thoroughness and honesty.” If you can remember the resentment, list it even though you think you have gotten over it.</p><p>Some people choose to write a short autobiography to jog their memory. Reviewing diaries, school annuals, family albums and the like may help. Avoid moral judgment of your feelings. Do NOT concern yourself with whether or not you should have felt the way you did. Just proceed with making your list and NOTHING MORE now.</p><p>While completing Step Four and perhaps for some time thereafter, you will recall other people and situations, which caused you to have these negative feelings. You can add to your list at any time, but do not spend a great deal of time now worrying about how complete your list is. Simply do the best you can over a reasonable period of time perhaps a week.</p><p>WITH THE GROUP:</p><p>Read and discuss the FOURTH STEP: Instruction 1 Resentments, and Instruction 2 Grudge List.</p><p><a href="/bb-sg/meetings/06">← Previous meeting</a></p><p><a href="/bb-sg/schedule.html">Back to schedule</a></p><p><a href="/bb-sg/meetings/glossary">Glossary →</a></p></div></article>
