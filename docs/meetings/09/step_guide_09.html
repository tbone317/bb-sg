Then follow Instruction 6 .</p><p>WITH THE GROUP: Discuss the work you have done so far and any problems you are having with Instructions 1 through 6. Assist those team members who are having problems with their Inventory. This may include spending time with them during the week.</p><p>INSTRUCTION 6  WHAT I DID As noted earlier, it is a spiritual axiom that when I am disturbed, no matter what the cause, there is something the matter with me. Now that you have listed the resentment and understand how it affected you, and having stopped blaming others by “putting out of your mind the wrongs others have done,” you can look at your own actions and reactions. In the past, we went no further than to declare that someone else was wrong. Isn’t it true that we acted or reacted during each event or circumstance? Didn’t we become angry; depressed; filled with selfpity, envy, jealousy, etc.? Didn’t this affect our lives and the lives of those close to us?</p><p>At the top of the fourth column on each page, insert the words “My Faults or Mistakes”.</p><p>Then complete Column 4 as follows: - A. For each person, institution or principle AND for each event, ask yourself:   - 1) Where have I been selfish, dishonest, selfseeking, frightened?   - 2) Where was I to blame?   - 3) How did I react?   - 4) How did this affect me and those close to - B. Write down your faults (as revealed by the above questions) in the fourth column opposite each person, institution or principle AND each event. Congratulations! If you have completed all the instructions to this point, you have finished the “Resentments” portion of your Inventory. You are ready to go to “Fear”. But do NOT proceed further at this time if any preceding portion remains incomplete.</p><p><a href="/meetings/08">← Previous meeting</a></p><p><a href="/schedule.html">Back to schedule</a></p><p><a href="/meetings/glossary">Glossary →</a></p></div></article>
