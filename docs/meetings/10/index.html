For example, being found out, being recognized for who we are. T11e Big Book says the driving force in the life of most alcoholics is the selfcentered fear that we will lose something we have or that we will not get something we think we need or want.</p><p>INSTRUCTION 7  LIST OF FEARS Read the last paragraph on page 67 in the Big Book and the first three paragraphs on page 68. Then list your fears. On a page following the section on resentments, write a short description of every fear you have experienced. You already asked yourself in the previous section about the impact of fear on your resentments. Now complete the list of times, places and circumstances that evoked this feeling (authority Figures, women, men,heights, snakes, bugs, etc., etc.).</p><p>INSTRUCTION 8  ANALYSIS OF FEARS Write a short analysis of each fear in an effort to understand it. It is said that each of these fears set in motion chains of circumstances which brought about or caused misfortune. Can you site examples where this occurred? Why did or do you, have each fear? Is it because of the failure of selfreliance? Were you about to be harmed in some way by something you could not control or avoid? Can you run away from fear? Did your fear affect others? What can you now rely upon if not yourself?</p><p>INSTRUCTION 9  IN PLACE OF FEAR Your fears have been listed and the above questions answered. Now read the solution to fear in the Big Book in the second and third paragraphs of page 68. “We ask Him to remove our fear and direct our attention to what He would have us be. At once,” the Book says, “we commence to outgrow fear.”</p><p>Direct this solution toward each one of your fears.</p><p><a href="/bb-sg/meetings/09">← Previous meeting</a></p><p><a href="/bb-sg/schedule.html">Back to schedule</a></p><p><a href="/bb-sg/meetings/glossary">Glossary →</a></p></div></article>
